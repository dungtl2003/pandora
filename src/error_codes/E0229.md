#### `E0229`: CannotCast

An incompatible cast was attempted.

Erroneous code example:
```
set s:str = "10a";
set a:int = s as int + 10;
println(a as str);
```

When casting, ensure that the value being cast is appropriate for the target type. Example:

```
set s:str = "10";
set a:int = s as int + 10;
println(a as str);
```
