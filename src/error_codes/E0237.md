#### `E0237`: InvalidLibraryPath

This error occurs when a function from a library is called using an incorrect or invalid path.

Erroneous code example:

```
lib.lib.lib.fn();
```

To fix this error, that the function or module you're trying to use is correctly specified with the right path. Example:

```
add math;
math.abs(-3.0);
```
