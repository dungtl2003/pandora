#### `E0235`: IndexingWrongType

An attempt to use index on a type which doesn't support indexing

Erroneous code example:
```
set mut arr:int = 10;
println(arr[3] as str);
```

To fix this error, ensure that you're indexing a type that supports it, such as arrays, ... Example:

```
set mut arr:[int] = [1,2,3];
println(arr[2] as str);
```
