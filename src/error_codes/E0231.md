#### `E0231`: cannot apply unary operator

This error occurs when you tried to use unary operation (`-`, `!`) with operands of incompatible data type.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
set s: str = "true";
set a: bool = !s; // !`str` is not allowed
```

To fix this error, you need to make sure to use unary operator on compatible data type.

Example:

```
// ok!
set s: str = "true";
set a: bool = !(s as bool); // this is ok because `bool` can perform `!` operation
```
