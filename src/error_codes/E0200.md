#### `E0200`: ExpectedBlockAfterCondition

This error indicates that the interpreter expected a block of statements to follow a conditional expression of `when` statement but did not find one.

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
when a<b ;
```

To fix this error, add a block of code {} after the condition. Example:

```
// ok!
when a<b {};
```
