#### `E0204`: continue outside loop

A continue statement was used outside of a loop.

Erroneous code example:

```
for e in [1, 2, 3] {}
skip; // continue statement outside loop
```

To fix this error, ensure that the continue statement is placed inside a loop. 

Example:

```
// ok!
for e in [1, 2, 3] {
    if (e == 2) {
        skip; // continue statement inside loop
    }
}
```
