#### `E0204`: ContinueOutsideLoop

A `skip` statement was used outside of a loop

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
for e in [1,2,3]{}
skip;
```

To fix this error, ensure that the `skip` statement is placed inside a loop. Example:

```
// ok!
for e in [1,2,3]{
    if (e == 2) {
        skip;
    }
}

```
