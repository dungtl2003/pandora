#### `E0208`: FunctionAlreadyDeclaredInScope

This error indicates that a function with the same name has already been defined in the current scope, and redefining it is not allowed.

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
fun main () {}
fun main () {}
```

Please verify you didn't misspell the function's name or remove/rename the duplicated one. Example:

```
// ok!
fun main1 () {}
fun main2 () {}

```
