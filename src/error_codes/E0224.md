#### `E0224`: CannotCompare

This error occurs when you tried to use compare operation such as `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` with operands of different or incompatible data types.

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
set a:str = "2025";
set b:int = 2024;
set c:bool = a > b;
println(c as str);
```

To fix this error, you can either convert one operand to match the other or use appropriate operations for the data types. Example:

```
// ok!
set a:str = "2025";
set b:int = 2024;
set c:bool = a as int > b;
println(c as str);

```
