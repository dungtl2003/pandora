#### `E0232`: invalid left-hand side of assignment

An assignment operator was used on a non-place expression.

Erroneous code example:

```
set a: int;
15 = a; // error!
println(a as str);
```

To fix this error, the left-hand side of an assignment operator must be a place expression. A place expression represents a memory location and can be a variable or an indexing expression.

Example:

```
set a: int;
a = 15; // valid left-hand side
println(a as str);
```
