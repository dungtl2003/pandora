#### `E0232`: InvalidLhsAssign

An assignment operator was used on a non-place expression.

Erroneous code example:
```
set mut a:int = 10;
a+5 = 15; // error!
println(a as str);
```

The left-hand side of an assignment operator must be a place expression. A place expression represents a memory location and can be a variable (with optional namespacing), a dereference, an indexing expression or a field reference.

And now let's give working examples:

```
set mut a:int = 10;
a = 15; // ok!
println(a as str);
```
