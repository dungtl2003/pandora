#### `E0239`: FunctionNotInScope

An unresolved function's name was used.

Erroneous code example:
```
fun hello(){
    println("hello");
}
hell(); // error: unresolved name `hell`
```

Or:

```
when true {
    fun hello(){
        println("hello");
    }
}
hello(); // error: unresolved name `hell`
```

Please verify that the name of function wasn't misspelled, ensure that the identifier being referred to is valid for the given situation, and confirm that the function is declared in a scope equal to or higher than the current one. Example:

```
when true {
    fun hello(){
        println("hello");
    }
    hello(); // ok!
}
```
