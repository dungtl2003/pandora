#### `E0239`: function not in scope

An unresolved function's name was used.

Erroneous code example:

```
fun hello(){
    println("hello");
}
hell(); // error: unresolved name `hell`
```

Or:

```
when true {
    fun hello(){
        println("hello");
    }
}
hello(); // error: unresolved name `hell`
```

Please verify that the name of function wasn't misspelled, ensure that the identifier being referred to is valid for the given situation, and confirm that the function is existed in the current scope.

Example:

```
when true {
    fun hello(){
        println("hello");
    }
    hello(); // ok!
}
```
