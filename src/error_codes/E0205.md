#### `E0205`: break outside loop

A break statement was used outside of a loop.

Erroneous code example:

```
for e in [1, 2, 3] {}
br; // break statement outside loop
```

To fix this error, ensure that the break statement is placed inside a loop. 

Example:

```
// ok!
for e in [1, 2, 3] {
    if (e == 2) {
        br;
    }
}
```
