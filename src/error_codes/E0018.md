#### `E0018`: UnexpectedClosingDelimiter

An unexpected closing delimiter appears without a matching opening delimiter.

Erroneous code example:
```
} ) ] // error!
```

To fix this error, ensure that each closing delimiter is matched with the correct opening delimiter. Example:

```
{} () [] // ok!
```
