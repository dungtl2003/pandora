#### `E0206`: ExpectedIterator

This error indicates that the `for` loop statement expected an iterator after the `in` keyword, but the provided expression is not iterable.

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
set arr:int = 10;
for e in arr {
    println(e as str);
}
```

To fix this error, ensure that the expression after `in` is an iterator. Example:

```
// ok!
set arr:[int] = [10,9,8,7,6,5];
for e in arr {
    println(e as str);
}

```
