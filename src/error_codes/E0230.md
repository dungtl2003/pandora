#### `E0230`: MismatchedType

Expected type did not match the received type.

Erroneous code example:
```
set s:str = 10;
```

This error occurs when an expression was used in a place where the compiler expected an expression of a different type. It can occur in several cases, the most common being when calling a function and passing an argument which has a different type than the matching type in the function declaration.

To fix this error, ensure that the expected type and received type are the same. Example:

```
set s:str = "10";
```
