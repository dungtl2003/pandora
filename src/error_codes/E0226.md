#### `E0226`: cannot find variable in scope

An unresolved variable's name was used.

Erroneous code example:

```
set s: str = other; // error: unresolved name `other`
```

Or:

```
fun hello_world(){
    set s: str = "hello world!";
}
println(s); // `s` doesn't existed in this scope
```

Please verify that the name wasn't misspelled, ensure that the identifier being referred to is valid for the given situation, and confirm that the variable is existed in the current scope. 

Example:

```
set other: str = "hello";
set s: str = other;
```

Or:

```
fun hello_world(){
    set s: str = "hello world!";
    println(s);
}
hello_world();
```
