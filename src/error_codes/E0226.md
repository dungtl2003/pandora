#### `E0226`: CannotFindVariableInScope

An unresolved variable's name was used.

Erroneous code example:
```
set hello_world:str = "hello world!";
set clone:str = hello_worl; // error: unresolved name `c`
```

Or:

```
fun hello_world(){
    set s:str = "hello world!";
}
println(s);
```

Please verify that the name wasn't misspelled, ensure that the identifier being referred to is valid for the given situation, and confirm that the variable is declared in a scope equal to or higher than the current one. Example:

```
set hello_world:str = "hello world!";
set clone:str = hello_world; // ok!
```

Or:

```
fun hello_world(){
    set s:str = "hello world!";
    println(s);
}
hello_world();
```
