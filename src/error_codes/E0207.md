#### `E0207`: ExpectedBlock

This error indicates that the interpreter expected a block of statements enclosed in braces `{` `}` following certain constructs such as a `for` iterator, a `while` condition, or the `alt` keyword of `if` statement, but did not find one.

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
for e in [1,2,3] ;
while true ;
when a<b {} alt ;
```

To fix this error, ensure that the expression after `in` is an iterator. Example:

```
// ok!
for e in [1,2,3] {};
while true {};
when a<b {} alt {};

```
