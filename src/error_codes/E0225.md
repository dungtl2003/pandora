#### `E0225`: no implementation for operator

This error occurs when you tried to use operators with operands of incompatible data types.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
set a: str = "true";
set b: bool = false;
set c: bool = a || b; // `str` || `bool` is not allowed
println(c as str);
```

To fix this error, you need to make sure to use operator on compatible data types.

Example:

```
set a: bool = true;
set b: bool = false;
set c: bool = a || b; // `bool` || `bool` is allowed
println(c as str);
```
