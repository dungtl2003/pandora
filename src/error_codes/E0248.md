#### `E0248`: PredefinedError

This error occurs when an invalid number of arguments or incorrect argument types are passed when calling a predefined function from a library such as `std` or `math`. These functions, like user-defined functions, expect specific arguments in both number and type. When these expectations are not met, the error is triggered.

See error code `E0240` for more information.
