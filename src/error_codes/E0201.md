#### `E0201`: UnknownSizeArray

This error indicates that the interpreter cannot determine the size of an array that has not been assigned any elements.

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
set x: [int];
println(arrlen(x) as str);
```

To fix this error, ensure that the array is assigned elements before attempting to retrieve its size. Example:

```
// ok!
set x: [int] = [1, 2, 3];
println(arrlen(x) as str);
```
