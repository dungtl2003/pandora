#### `E0202`: mismatch array type length

Expected array size did not match the received size.

Erroneous code example:

```
set x: [int; 3] = [1, 2]; // expected array size 3, found 2
```

To fix this error, ensure that the expected array has the same size as the received array. 

Example:

```
// ok!
set x: [int; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
```
