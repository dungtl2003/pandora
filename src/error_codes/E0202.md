#### `E0202`: MismatchArrayTypeLength

Expected array size did not match the received size

Erroneous code example:
```
// error!
set x: [int;3] = [1,2];
```

To fix this error, ensure that the expected array has the same size as the received array. Example:

```
// ok!
set x: [int;3] = [1, 2, 3];
```
