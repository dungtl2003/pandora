#### `E0234`: IndexOutOfBounds

This error occurs when you try to access an element of an array using an index that is out of the valid range of the array, meaning the index is not within the range 0 to length - 1 of the array.

Erroneous code example:
```
set mut arr:[int] = [1,2,3];
println(arr[3] as str);
```

To fix this error, you need to ensure that the index you're accessing is within the valid range of the array. Example:

```
set mut arr:[int] = [1,2,3];
println(arr[2] as str);
```
