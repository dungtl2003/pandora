#### `E0244`: mutate immutable variable

An immutable variable was reassigned.

Erroneous code example:

```
set a: int = 1;
a = 2; // error!
```

By default, variables in Pandora are immutable. To fix this error, add the keyword `mut` after the keyword `set` when declaring the variable. 

Example:

```
set mut a: int = 1;
a = 2; // ok!
```

Alternatively, you might consider initializing a new variable: either with a new bound name or (by shadowing) with the bound name of your existing variable. 

Example:

```
set a: int = 1;
set a: int = 2; // ok!
```
