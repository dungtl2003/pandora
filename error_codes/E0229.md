#### `E0229`: cannot cast

An incompatible cast was attempted.

Erroneous code example:

```
set s: str = "10a";
set a: int = s as int + 10; // 10a cannot be casted to `int`
println(a as str);
```

When casting, ensure that the value being cast is appropriate for the target type. 

Example:

```
set s: str = "10";
set a: int = s as int + 10;
println(a as str);
```
