#### `E0222`: cannot divide

This error occurs when you tried to use `/` operation with operands of incompatible data types.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
set a: str = "2025";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: int = a / b; // `str` / `int` is not allowed
println(c);
```

To fix this error, you need to make sure to use `/` operator on compatible data types.

Example:

```
// ok!
set a: str = "2025";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: int = a as int / b; // `int` / `int` is allowed
println(c as str);
```
