#### `E0100`: expected token

This error indicates that the statement expected one of a specific set of tokens but encountered a different token.

Erroneous code example:

```
for e in {
    println(e as str);
} 
// error: after `in`, interpreter expected one of 5 possible tokens (constant, identifier, `(`, `[`, found `{`) but it found '{'.
```

To fix this error, replace the unexpected token with one of the expected tokens to match the correct syntax. 

Example:

```
for e in [1, 2, 3] {
    println(e as str);
}
```
