#### `E0221`: cannot multiply

This error occurs when you tried to use `*` operation with operands of incompatible data types.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
set a: str = "2025";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: int = a * b; // `str` * `int` is not allowed
println(c);
```

To fix this error, you need to make sure to use `*` operator on compatible data types.

```
// ok!
set a: str = "2025";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: int = a as int * b; // `int` * `int` is allowed
println(c as str);
```
