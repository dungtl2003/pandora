#### `E0215`: non function declared in external library

This error occurs when there is a non-function command in root scope of an external library.

Erroneous code example:

In mylib.boxx:

``` 
set myvar: int = 10; // non-function command in root scope
```

To fix this error, ensure that all commands in root scope of an external library are functions.

Example:

In mylib.boxx:

``` 
fun myfunc() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}

fun myfunc2() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}
```
