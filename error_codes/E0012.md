#### `E0012`: unknown character escape

This error occurs when a character escape sequence is used that is not recognized by Pandora's syntax. Pandora supported some character escape: `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\0`, `\\`, `\'`, `\"`.

Erroneous code example:

```
set x: char = '\a';
```

To fix this error, ensure that the escape sequence is a valid and supported character in the Pandora. 

Example:

```
set x: char = '\n';
```
