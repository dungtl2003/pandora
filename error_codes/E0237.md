#### `E0237`: invalid library path

This error occurs when a function from a library is called using an incorrect or invalid path.

Erroneous code example:

```
lib.lib.lib.fn();
```

To fix this error, that the function or module you're trying to use is correctly specified with the right path. For now, pandora only supports one level of library path. That means you can only use the library name directly.

Example:

```
add math;
math.abs(-3.0);
```
