#### `E0230`: mismatched type

This error occurs when an expression was used in a place where the interpreter expected an expression of a different type.

Erroneous code example:

```
set s: str = 10;
```

To fix this error, ensure that the expected type and received type are the same. 

Example:

```
set s: str = "10";
```
