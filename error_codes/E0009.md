#### `E0009`: raw string unterminated

A raw string isn't correctly terminated because the trailing '#' count doesn't match its leading '#' count.

Erroneous code example:

```
set r#raw_str: str = r#"##"; // error!
```

To terminate a raw string, you have to have the same number of # at the end as at the beginning. 

Example:

```
set r#raw_str: str = r#"##"#; // ok!
```
