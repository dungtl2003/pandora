#### `E0200`: expected block after condition

This error indicates that the interpreter expected a block of statements to follow a conditional expression of `when` statement but did not find one.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
when true 
    println("true");
```

To fix this error, add a block of code `{}` after the condition. 

Example:

```
// ok!
when true {
    println("true");
};
```
