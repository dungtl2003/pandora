#### `E0224`: cannot compare

This error occurs when you tried to use compare operation such as `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` with incompatible data types.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
set a: str = "2025";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: bool = a > b; // `str` > `int` is not allowed
println(c as str);
```

To fix this error, you need to make sure to use compare operator on compatible data types.

Example:

```
// ok!
set a: str = "2025";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: bool = a as int > b; // `int` > `int` is not allowed
println(c as str);
```
