#### `E0207`: expected block

This error indicates that the interpreter expected a block of statements enclosed in braces `{` `}` following certain constructs such, but did not find one.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
for e in [1, 2, 3] 
    println(e as str);
```

To fix this error, add a block of code `{}` after the construct. 

Example:

```
// ok!
for e in [1, 2, 3] {
    println(e as str);
}
```
