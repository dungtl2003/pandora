#### `E0236`: library not found

An attempt to use a non-exist library.

Erroneous code example:

directory
|_ main.box
|_ lib.boxx

``` in main.box
add non_exist_lib;
```

To fix this error, ensure that the library you're trying to use exists.

Example:

directory
|_ main.box
|_ lib.boxx

``` in main.box
add lib;
```
