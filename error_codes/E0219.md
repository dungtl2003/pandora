#### `E0219`: cannot add

This error occurs when you tried to use `+` operation with operands of incompatible data types.

Erroneous code example:

```
// error!
set a: str = "hello ";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: str = a + b; // `str` + `int` is not allowed
println(c);
```

To fix this error, you need to make sure to use `+` operator on compatible data types.

Example:

```
set a: str = "2024";
set b: int = 2024;
set c: str = a as int + b; // `int` + `int` is allowed
println(c);
```
