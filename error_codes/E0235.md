#### `E0235`: indexing wrong type

An attempt to use index on a type which doesn't support indexing.

Erroneous code example:

```
set num: int = 10;
println(num[3] as str); // `int` doesn't support indexing
```

To fix this error, ensure that you're indexing a type that supports it. For now, only arrays support indexing. 

Example:

```
set mut arr: [int] = [1, 2, 3];
println(arr[2] as str);
```
