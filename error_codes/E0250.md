#### `E0250`: array has multiple types

This error occurs when you try to create an array with multiple types. All elements in an array must be of the same type.

Erroneous code example:

```
fun main() {
    let arr = [1, 2.3, "hello"]; // multiple types in array
}
```

To fix this error, make sure all elements in the array are of the same type.

Example:

```
fun main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
}
```
